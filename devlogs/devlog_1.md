## DevLog 1 - Adding the `!run` command to send crypto information to the user

In this delivery, the objective was to add the `!run` command with some functionality related to APIs. In this direction, I decided to make the bot respond to the `!run` command with data about a cryptocurrency using the [CoinCap API](https://docs.coincap.io/#intro), which offers a free service up to a certain number of requests. This command is **useful** for Discord users who invest in or follow the cryptocurrency market and would like to track their favorite coins from within Discord, even being able to view and download price charts of the cryptocurrency over time directly from Discord.

The command was relatively simple to implement. The most labor-intensive parts were formatting the information in a way that would be interesting for the user to view and organizing the code coherently. The main sources of reference for this part were the [CoinCap API documentation](https://docs.coincap.io/#ee30bea9-bb6b-469d-958a-d3e35d442d7a), the [discord.py documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and occasionally ChatGPT to simplify some implementations or even to ask about functions and parameters of discord.py.
