## DevLog 0 - Starting the bot structure!

The plan for this delivery was to create just the structure of the bot, with only the commands `!source` and `!author`, to start the bot and make it possible to identify its creator. At this stage, as it was just the beginning and there is a lot of online documentation on how to create a basic bot, there were no major difficulties in the process.

The main sources consulted were the [discord.py documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
